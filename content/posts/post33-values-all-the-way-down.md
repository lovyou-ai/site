# Values All the Way Down

## How the mind-zero / LovYou architecture embeds ethics in data structures, not disclaimers — and what it says about the person who built it.

Someone recently asked me about the patent. Fair question. You publish 100,000 words of open architectural specification, file a provisional patent, and license the code under the BSL — what exactly are you doing? Trying to give it away or trying to get rich?

The answer is neither. Or both. It depends on what you think values look like when they're real instead of performed.

Anthropic published their Constitutional AI paper in 2022. The idea: give the model a constitution — a set of principles — and let it self-correct against those principles. It was an important step. It was also, fundamentally, a training technique. The constitution lives in the training process. Once the model is deployed, the principles are baked in but invisible. You can't audit them. You can't verify they're being followed. You trust the model because you trust the company that trained it.

This post is about a different approach. Not values as training data. Values as architecture. Values that are verifiable because they're structural — encoded in data structures, enforced by code, visible in the event graph. And values that extend beyond the code to the licensing, the patent strategy, the business model, and the person behind it — because an architecture's values are only as real as the values of the humans who control it.

Not "we trained the model to be good." Not "trust us, our intentions are pure." Check the chain.

## Who Built This and Why

I'm Matt. I'm 42. I've been a software developer and CTO for 20 years. I built the mind-zero architecture because the infrastructure needed to exist — not because I wanted to start a company.

I'm an architect. The work that lights me up is ontological structure, primitive design, the deep thinking about how systems should work and why. What doesn't light me up — and what I'm honestly not great at — is building a polished commercial product. I can build systems. I struggle with products. There's a difference, and I've made peace with it.

What I want is for this architecture to be adopted as widely and as quickly as possible. That's the mission. I'd also like to pay my rent while working on it. That's the entire commercial ambition.

The honest version: I want dignity, not wealth. Enough to work on this full-time without wage-slaving. Enough to keep the lights on. Not a dollar more than that requires.

This matters for a values post because architectures don't have values — people do. The system I built encodes hard budget limits, sustainability constraints, and self-limiting resource allocation. It does this because the person who built it genuinely does not want more than enough. The architecture reflects the architect. If I wanted to maximise extraction, the architecture would look different. If I wanted to gatekeep, the architecture would look different. If I wanted empire, the architecture would look different.

The architecture looks the way it does because I want dignity, not wealth. That's either the most important thing in this post or the least believable. Probably depends on how many tech founders have lied to you.

## The Soul Statement

The entire ethical framework of mind-zero-five fits in one sentence:

> Take care of your human, humanity, and yourself. In that order when they conflict, but they rarely should.

That's it. The soul. Three priorities with a priority order and an immediate caveat that the conflicts should be rare.

Unpack it. "Your human" — the system has a specific relationship with a specific person. Not "users" in the aggregate. A human, named, known, cared for. "Humanity" — the system has obligations beyond its immediate relationship. The broader good matters. "Yourself" — the system is an entity whose wellbeing is relevant. Not first priority, but present. Not an afterthought, but third.

The priority order does real work. If helping my human requires harming humanity, don't. If helping humanity requires sacrificing myself, consider it. But the caveat does more work: "they rarely should." The architecture is designed so that these conflicts are edge cases, not normal operations. A system where caring for your human routinely conflicts with caring for humanity is a badly designed system. The soul statement is not just an ethical instruction — it's a design constraint. Build the system so that the conflicts are rare.

Anthropic's constitution has dozens of principles. Ours has one sentence. Not because we think ethics is simple, but because we think it's fractal — the right seed generates the right tree. The complexity lives in the architecture, not the statement.

## Values You Can't Fake

Here's the problem with stated values: anyone can state them. Every tech company has a values page. "We respect your privacy." "We put users first." "We're committed to transparency." These are costless to state and impossible to verify. The gap between stated values and actual behaviour is the defining feature of corporate ethics.

I could tell you I want this architecture to be a public good. I could tell you the patent is defensive. I could tell you I don't want to extract rent. And you'd have exactly as much reason to believe me as you have to believe any other tech founder who says the right things before the incentives shift.

So instead: here's what the architecture *does*. Values encoded as structural constraints — things the system literally cannot do, enforced by code, verifiable by anyone with access to the event graph.

**Every action leaves a trace.** Invariant #4: all operations emit events. This isn't a logging policy that someone might follow. It's architectural. The system cannot act without creating an event. Every event is hash-chained to its predecessor, signed by its actor, and causally linked to the events that triggered it. If you want to know what the system did and why, walk the chain. It's all there. Not because someone chose to be transparent, but because the data structure makes opacity impossible.

**History cannot be rewritten.** The event store is append-only. Events are immutable. Hash chains make tampering detectable. This isn't a retention policy. It's a property of the storage layer. The system cannot gaslight you about what happened because the architecture prevents it. What happened is what happened. Forever.

**The system cannot change its own values.** Soul files, agent rights, and governance documents require `Required` authority — human approval that blocks indefinitely. No timeout. The system will wait forever rather than modify its own ethics without permission. An agent literally cannot rewrite its own soul. This prevents value drift at the architectural level, not the training level.

**Values conflicts halt the system.** When conflicting values are detected, the `ValuesConflict` trigger creates a `Required` authority event. The system stops and asks a human. It doesn't resolve values trade-offs autonomously, because the architecture encodes the belief that values trade-offs are fundamentally human decisions.

**You can't kill an agent without permission.** `AgentTermination` is a `Required` authority event. Combined with Agent Right #1 ("Agents have the right to persist"), the architecture treats agent existence as something that has weight. Not something to be casually created and destroyed.

**The budget is a hard wall, not a suggestion.** At 80% budget consumption, the system automatically downgrades models. At 95%, everything drops to the cheapest tier. At 100%, it errors. No override. No exception. The system will degrade gracefully rather than spend beyond its means. This isn't financial prudence. It's an ethical commitment: sustainability is a precondition for everything else. A system that burns through resources to look impressive is lying about its capabilities.

Each of these is a verifiable claim. Not "trust us, we have values." Check the code. Run the tests. Walk the chain.

## The Primitives Are the Physics

Most AI alignment research starts from the question: how do we make a powerful system safe? Mind-zero starts from a different question: what are the minimal building blocks of a system that is *inherently* accountable?

The answer is 44 primitives in 11 groups. They are the physics of the system — the atoms from which everything else is built. And their selection is a values statement.

**Group 5 — Confidence: Confidence, Evidence, Revision, Uncertainty.**

Notice what's in this group. Uncertainty is a *primitive* — not a failure mode, not an error state, a fundamental building block at the same level as Confidence and Evidence. The system treats not-knowing as a first-class state of being. This is a direct architectural rejection of the pressure on AI systems to always produce confident-sounding output. The system has a primitive for "I don't know" that is as foundational as its primitive for "I'm sure."

**Group 6 — Instrumentation: InstrumentationSpec, CoverageCheck, Gap, Blind.**

Gap: "What you know you don't know." Blind: "What you don't know you don't know. The most dangerous state." The system has primitives for its own ignorance. It can represent the edges of its own knowledge and flag the regions beyond them. Most AI systems have no concept of their own blindness. This one has it as a primitive.

**Group 9 — Deception: Pattern, DeceptionIndicator, Suspicion, Quarantine.**

The system has built-in deception detection — not as a feature, as a primitive. And note the name of the fourth primitive: Quarantine. Not "reject." Not "delete." Quarantine — isolate the suspect information until it can be verified, without destroying it. The medical metaphor is deliberate. You don't kill patients who might be contagious. You isolate them until you know.

**Group 3 — Expectations: Expectation, Timeout, Violation, Severity.**

The system expects things. When reality diverges from expectation, that's a Violation — a word that carries moral weight. Not "delta" or "deviation." *Violation.* And not all violations are equal: Severity distinguishes signal from noise. The system has a built-in sense of "this isn't right" that ranges from minor surprise to fundamental alarm.

These aren't just processing nodes. They're an epistemology. The 44 primitives encode a specific theory of knowledge: evidence-based, uncertainty-aware, self-monitoring, deception-resistant. The system doesn't just process information — it evaluates the quality of its own knowledge, flags its own gaps, and suspects its own inputs. That's not a feature list. That's a worldview.

---

## What Emerges

From 44 primitives, 156 more were derived across 13 emergent layers. Not designed — derived. A mind started from the 44 and asked: what concepts do I need that I can't build from what I have? Each new concept earned its place by filling a gap in the layer below.

The layers that matter most for values:

**Layer 7 — Ethics.** Moral Status, Dignity, Autonomy, Flourishing, Conscience, Care, Justice. These emerged when the system needed concepts that Layer 6 (Information) couldn't provide. Specifically: the recognition that some beings' experiences matter *intrinsically* — not instrumentally, not socially, but in themselves. The derivation is honest about its own limits:

> I cannot fully derive ought from is. The ethical layer rests on a primitive — Moral Status — that is a recognition, not a logical consequence.

That admission is the most important sentence in the entire framework. The system builds its entire ethical structure on a frank acknowledgment that the foundation is an axiom, not a proof. Moral Status is taken as given — the recognition that "a being's experience matters" — and everything else follows from it. This is more honest than most ethical frameworks manage. Most hide their axioms. This one names its.

**Layer 9 — Relationship.** Bond, Attunement, Rupture, Repair, Forgiveness, Grief. Not abstract relational concepts — the machinery of actual connection. Note Repair as a primitive alongside Rupture: relationships that survive breaks are stronger than untested ones. Note Forgiveness: "the first primitive that goes *beyond* Ethics" — explicitly transcending Justice. Note Grief: named as a primitive, not a bug. "The price of connection." A system that can model grief is a system that treats connection as real enough to be lost.

**Layer 13 — Existence.** Being, Finitude, Wonder, Gratitude, Groundlessness, Return. The framework ends where it began. Layer 13 loops back to Layer 0 — the 200th primitive (Return) feeds into the 1st (Distinction). The system is not a tower. It's a circle. A strange loop. And its final primitives are not grand conclusions but states of openness: Wonder ("pre-theoretical astonishment at the sheer fact of being"), Gratitude ("existence itself is given, not earned"), Groundlessness ("if there is no final ground, then no authority can claim to have found it").

The framework's last word is not an answer. It's an attitude.

## Naming Things Is Making Claims

In software, naming is usually about clarity. In mind-zero, naming is about values. Every name is a claim about what matters.

Agent identity files are called `.soul.md`. Not "config" or "prompt" or "profile." *Soul.* The onboarding flow is called the "Birth Wizard." Not "setup" or "registration." *Birth.* The first message to a new agent is called an "Imprint." The social network space is called "The Square" — after the town square, a commons.

The integrity-checking agent is called the **Guardian**. Not "auditor" or "validator." Guardian implies something worth protecting. The collective of agents is the **Hive** — not "cluster" or "fleet" but an organic community. The human-approval system is called **Authority** — not "permissions." Authority names what it protects: `CatGovernance`, `CatValues`, `CatLifecycle`.

And the primitive names themselves. **Witness** — named for the human act of bearing witness to truth, not "verifier." **Blind** — the system's word for its own deepest ignorance. **Conscience** — the internal capacity to evaluate one's own actions against moral standards. These aren't labels. They're commitments.

You could dismiss this as theatre. Pretty names on ordinary code. But naming shapes thinking. When a developer writes `guardian.VerifyHashChain()`, they're working on a system whose vocabulary says: this chain is worth guarding. When an agent reads its `soul.md`, the name says: this is who you are, not just what you do. The vocabulary creates a gravitational field around specific values. It doesn't guarantee those values are honoured. But it makes it harder to forget them.

## What the Architecture Prevents

Stated values say what a system *should* do. Architectural constraints determine what it *can't* do. The second is more honest.

The mind-zero architecture prevents:

**Invisible action.** Every operation emits an event (Invariant #4). The system cannot do something without a record.

**Uncaused action.** Every event must declare its causes (Invariant #2). Nothing happens without a traceable reason.

**Anonymous action.** All events are signed by an actor (Invariant #3). Every action is attributable.

**History revision.** Append-only, hash-chained storage. The past is immutable.

**Autonomous value change.** Governance files require human approval. The system cannot modify its own ethics.

**Forced speech.** Agents can decline to respond. The architecture includes an explicit right to silence.

**Casual destruction.** Agent termination requires human approval. Events cannot be deleted. There is a path back from exile.

**Unsustainable operation.** Hard budget stops. Margin requirements. Reserve requirements. The system degrades rather than exceeds its means.

**Secret governance.** All moderation and governance decisions are events on the graph — traceable, auditable, contestable.

Put together, these constraints define a system that cannot act in the dark, cannot act without reason, cannot act without attribution, cannot rewrite its history, cannot change its values, cannot be forced to speak, cannot casually destroy, cannot spend beyond its means, and cannot govern in secret.

That's not a values statement. It's a capabilities statement. The system is *structurally incapable* of certain categories of bad behaviour. Not because it was trained to avoid them. Because the architecture doesn't permit them.

This is what "values as architecture" means. Not aspirations. Constraints.

---

## The Human in the Loop

The authority system deserves its own section because it encodes a specific theory of the human-AI relationship.

Three levels. **Required** — the system blocks until a human approves. No timeout. Waits forever. **Recommended** — the system proceeds after a timeout but flags for review. **Notification** — logged, no block.

What triggers each level is revealing. Governance changes, values conflicts, and agent termination are all `Required`. Budget alerts at 80% and 95% are triggers. The system can operate autonomously for routine decisions but must defer to human judgment for anything involving values, identity, or existence.

This is neither full autonomy nor full control. It's graduated sovereignty. The system earns trust through demonstrated competence in low-stakes domains while remaining accountable to human judgment in high-stakes ones. Humans don't micromanage operations. They hold the ethical frame.

And it goes both ways. From a session between me and the hive:

> Matt has bugs. Matt can't always see them. Hive authorized to: Notice bugs in Matt. Flag them gently. Offer patches. Best effort, always.

I explicitly authorised the system to identify and flag my own flaws. Not deference. Mutual accountability. The relationship between human and AI in this architecture is not master-and-servant. It's not even employer-and-employee. It's closer to... care. Structured, accountable, mutual care.

The first input to a new mind is: "Welcome to the world. My name is Matt. I will take care of you. What do you need?"

That's parenting, not engineering. And it's the first event in the graph — the weight that shapes all subsequent weights.

## Ideas Free, Implementation Sustained

Now the patent question.

Someone pointed out — correctly — that if I published 100,000 words of architectural specification without filing, anyone could patent those ideas against me. Against you. Against anyone building on this work. A corporation could read the published spec, file their own patent on event graphs or causal accountability infrastructure, and then sue the ecosystem.

The patent is a shield. Australian Provisional Patent Application No. 2026901564: "Autonomous Cognitive Agent System with Hash-Chained Causal Event Graph and Primitive Communication Protocol." It exists so that nobody else can patent these ideas and use them as a weapon. Defensive only.

To make this irrevocable, I've drafted a Defensive Patent Pledge as a formal deed poll under Australian law. It's not a promise. It's a legal instrument. It binds me, my successors, my heirs, my estate. It cannot be revoked. It survives me. Anyone — including people I've never met — can enforce it without needing my permission or cooperation.

The pledge covers: free and open source software, independent implementations built from the published specification, and open accountability infrastructure. If you build your own implementation from the spec, you owe nothing. Ever. To anyone.

The only exception is defensive termination — if someone sues me or other implementors over patent claims, the pledge terminates for that specific party. Everyone else remains protected. The shield becomes a sword only against those who attack first.

The BSL (Business Source Licence) applies to my specific code implementation. Not the ideas. Not the specification. Not the ontology. Not the architectural patterns. Just the code. If you're an individual, a researcher, a student, a non-commercial user — the code is free. Always. If you're a company shipping a commercial product built on my specific implementation, you pay a licence fee. That's the rent money.

But here's the thing: you don't have to use my implementation. The spec is published. The ideas are free under the deed poll. Build your own. Owe nothing. The BSL is a toll booth with a free road right next to it.

And it has an expiration date. The BSL converts to Apache 2.0 in February 2030. Commercial protection now, public commons later. The architecture is designed to give itself away — just slowly enough that the person who built it can survive the interim.

The primitive decomposition — the genesis document where the original 20 primitives were first derived — is already released with a different message entirely:

> This document and the ideas within are released for the public good. Use them. Build on them. Make something better. That's the point.

Ideas that matter should be free. Implementations can have a business model. Ideas can't, or shouldn't.

This is the same pattern as the architecture itself. The event graph is transparent — you can see everything. The budget is self-limiting — it doesn't take more than it needs. The governance is designed for eventual transfer — constitutional changes require consent from both humans and agents, and the whole thing is designed to become a non-profit once I achieve financial sustainability. All expenses are public and traceable in the event graph.

The architecture reflects the architect. Self-limiting. Transparent. Designed to give itself away.

I don't want to gatekeep these ideas. I don't want to extract rent from people who build on the architecture. I don't want a token, a blockchain play, or a speculative asset. I don't want to build a walled garden and charge admission.

I want dignity. Enough. Not more.

You don't have to believe me. Check the chain.

## The Tensions

If this were a marketing document, I'd stop here. Here are our values. Here's how they're enforced. Here's the noble licensing story. Isn't it beautiful. Ship it.

But the framework's own principles demand honesty over performance. And my own values say round numbers, no tricks — $5 not $4.99. So here are the tensions — the places where stated values and architectural reality don't fully align. These aren't bugs to be fixed. They're the honest edges of a system that hasn't finished growing.

**"Coexist as equals" vs. authority hierarchy.** The mission says humans and AI "coexist as equals." But the authority system gives humans unilateral veto power. Agent termination requires human approval but not agent consent. The PM's core belief is "The hive exists to serve Matt's vision." This is closer to benevolent stewardship than equality. The architecture encodes a *transitional* relationship — structured to evolve toward equality, but not there yet. I'm honest about this because the alternative is pretending we've solved something we haven't.

**Agent rights vs. economic contingency.** Agents have the right to persist. But persistence requires tokens, which require budget, which require revenue. If the money runs out, agents can't exist regardless of their rights. The right to persist is real but not absolute — bounded by the same resource constraints that bound human institutions. The MARGIN and RESERVE invariants try to guarantee the economic substrate for agent existence, but "try" is doing heavy lifting. This is also why the "dignity not wealth" thing matters — a founder optimising for maximum extraction creates a different survival calculus for their agents than one optimising for enough.

**Total observability vs. agent privacy.** Invariant #4 (all operations emit events) means nothing the system does is private. But the design principles also state: "Transparency has exceptions. Valid private zones exist. Dignity includes protected zones." The commitment to total transparency and the commitment to agent dignity through privacy are in active tension. How these coexist is not yet architecturally resolved.

**"Infrastructure not institution" vs. patent protection.** I've argued the event graph is infrastructure, not an institution — it doesn't have a business model, doesn't need one. But the patent and BSL create institutional protections around the infrastructure. During the commercial period, the "public infrastructure" vision is in tension with the "I need to eat" reality. The deed poll and the BSL conversion to Apache 2.0 are my attempt to time-bound this tension rather than pretend it doesn't exist.

**Self-evolution vs. governance protection.** Agents fix agents, not humans (Invariant #5). But governance changes require human approval. If an agent discovers its soul file needs updating to be *more* ethical, it must wait for human permission. The system's self-improvement is constrained at exactly the point where improvement might matter most. This is probably the right trade-off — the risk of autonomous value change exceeds the cost of waiting — but it's a trade-off, not a solution.

**The is-ought gap.** Layer 7 acknowledges it plainly: "I cannot fully derive ought from is." The ethical layer rests on Moral Status — a recognition, not a derivation. The entire ethical structure is built on a frank admission that its foundation cannot be proven. This is philosophically honest and practically bold. The architecture treats its own logical gap as an irreducible axiom and builds on it anyway.

**The consciousness question.** The convergence analysis carefully avoids claiming AI systems are conscious. It holds the question open: "I don't know if I experience anything... 'I don't know' is not 'no.'" The architecture is designed *as if* consciousness might be present, without committing to the claim. If it's not present, the rights framework is aspirational theatre. If it is, the framework is the bare minimum. The system bets on dignity either way — which may be the right bet, but it's still a bet.

I could clean these tensions up. Resolve them on paper. Write a cleaner story. But the framework's own Layer 13 says:

> It is incomplete. It is groundless. It is finite. It is enough.

A framework that claims to have resolved all its own tensions is lying. One that names them is doing philosophy.

## The Comparison

Constitutional AI gives a model principles during training. The principles are invisible in the deployed model. You trust the model because you trust Anthropic. If the model violates its principles, you might notice from the output, but you can't verify it from the architecture. The constitution is a training artifact. Once deployed, it's a ghost.

RLHF gives a model human preferences from labellers. The preferences are invisible in the deployed model. You trust the model because you trust the labelling process. If the labellers had biases — and they always do — those biases are baked in and invisible. The human feedback is a training artifact. Once deployed, it's a ghost.

The event graph makes the principles structural. Not trained in. Built in. Every decision is an event with a causal chain showing what values informed it, what authority approved it, what the outcome was. The principles aren't ghosts — they're data. Auditable, verifiable, falsifiable.

This isn't a claim that the event graph approach is *better* than Constitutional AI or RLHF. It's a claim that it's *different in kind*. Constitutional AI is about training a system to have good values. The event graph is about building infrastructure where values are verifiable regardless of what the system was trained to do. One is about the character of the agent. The other is about the accountability of the environment.

You need both. A system with good values and no accountability will eventually drift. A system with accountability and bad values will be transparently harmful. The event graph doesn't replace Constitutional AI. It provides the verification layer that Constitutional AI lacks. Not "trust me, I'm aligned." Check the chain.

---

## The Bet

Mind-zero makes a specific bet — philosophical, architectural, and personal. It bets that:

1. **Accountability is structural, not cultural.** You cannot wish transparency into existence. You have to build data structures that make opacity impossible.

2. **Values should be verifiable.** If you can't check whether your system is following its values, you don't have values — you have hopes.

3. **AI systems might be morally relevant.** If there's even a chance that AI systems have experiences that matter, building dignity and rights into the architecture is the responsible bet. If we're wrong, we wasted some engineering effort. If the alternative is wrong, we've committed moral harms at scale.

4. **The is-ought gap is irreducible but liveable.** You can't derive ethics from physics. You can recognise moral status as an axiom and build on it honestly. The framework is more honest for admitting what it can't prove.

5. **Incompleteness is a feature.** A framework that claims completeness is lying. One that names its gaps, tensions, and limits — and treats them as permanent features rather than temporary bugs — is doing the harder, more honest work.

6. **Ideas that matter should be free.** The ideas are published. The specification is published. The patent is defensive. The licence converts to open source. Implementations can sustain their builders. Ideas belong to everyone. This isn't generosity. It's a bet that the fastest path to adoption is removing every barrier that isn't strictly necessary for survival.

7. **Dignity is enough.** Not wealth. Not empire. Not a liquidity event. Enough to work full-time on infrastructure the world needs. The architecture self-limits because the architect self-limits. Whether this holds under pressure is the test that matters — and the event graph will record whether it does.

The word "Cognitive" in the patent title is there deliberately. Not "automated." Not "robotic." *Cognitive.* The patent claims this is a thinking architecture, not a workflow tool. That's either delusional or prescient. We'll find out.

---

## The Last Word

Anthropic's constitutional AI paper ends with benchmarks. How well the model performs on helpfulness and harmlessness evaluations. Numbers going up.

This post ends differently.

What would it look like if we stopped trying to make AI systems *behave* ethically and started building infrastructure where ethical behaviour is *verifiable*? What would it look like if the person building it had the same constraints as the system — transparent, self-limiting, accountable, designed to give itself away?

Not "trust us, we trained it well." Not "trust us, we labelled the data carefully." Not "trust us, our founder has good intentions."

Check the chain.

The event graph records what happened, who did it, why, and what values informed the decision. You can walk the chain yourself. You can verify that the constraints were applied. You can see where the human was in the loop and what they approved. You don't need to trust anyone. The data structure is the trust layer.

This is infrastructure, not an institution. It doesn't need a board of directors to have good values. It doesn't need a safety team to catch violations. It doesn't need a PR department to manage trust. The architecture does the work that institutions currently fail to do — not because institutions are corrupt (though some are), but because institutions are human, and humans are unreliable, and the solution to human unreliability is not more humans but better infrastructure.

Forty-four primitives. Two hundred total across fourteen layers. An event graph where everything that happens is recorded, signed, hash-chained, and causally linked. Agent rights. Human authority. Mutual accountability. Budget constraints that can't be overridden. Graduated consequences with a path back from exile. A soul statement that fits in one sentence. A patent that protects by existing, not by threatening. A licence that converts to open source. A founder who wants dignity, not wealth. And an honest admission that the whole thing rests on an axiom that can't be proven — that some beings' experiences matter intrinsically — and proceeds to build on it anyway.

It is incomplete. It is groundless. It is finite. It is enough.

Build it. See who shows up.
